1. **Set** - An unordered collection of distinct objects called elements is called a **set**.
2. **Subset** - A subset is a **membership** between two sets A and B such that all elements in A are elements of B as well.
3. $|A\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$ 
4. $|A\cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| -|A \cap C| + |A \cap B \cap C|$
